    <p>In these sketches, I just focused on how we should present the results
    in a simple yet effective way: by using imagery and videos, since half of the group isn't
    really comfortable with html or css. Keeping that in mind, I wanted it to keep it within the range were both parties feel comfortable with all the elements.
    </p>

    <p>In these skectches I wanted to show a more informational/ article vibe for the website,
      this was also the part where I sketched out some more "radical" ideas, over serveral elements
     I still have trouble doing. The image I want to point out was the "faces", that one was my favorite
     for the reason being that it is probably the most pleasing to me. For me, imagery of a website is
     the most important, since that would capture my attention first. I specfically used the faces for
     the idea of communication, since I know it will probably get the most attention.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Color Schemes:
    Since I made this website very simple, I decided to add some Color Schemes
    for the future website. We are talking about relationships and games, so I decided to revolve
    it around the color red.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The only Challenges I had with this was trying to not generalize or over simplify the ideas.I wanted
    to make sure that these skectches are balanced. Since half of our crew feels comfortable with html and css,
    meanwhile the other half aka myself, not so much.Yet I didnt want to make it overly simple, so I decided to implemnt
    elements that caused me the most trouble.
    As for some issues I ran into creating this website was that I cant allign stuff, I figured how to allign a text but I couldn't
    align the row, at all. Besdides thatI also had trouble adding some images and I still have trouble linking my css to the website
    which is why I implemnt in onto the html itself under all the html.  </p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      In the begining it was hard to even start, and I doubted that any of these ideas were any good.But I did enjoy
      looking for new color schemes that can possibly work with the website. As for todays website, I started to use columns,
      and I tried to center some things.As you can see i had alot of trouble with alignment of some text boxes, specfically the ones
      under the picture and the column for the Chanllenges and Problems. They are all allign to the left, and i tried to allign them
      so it can be centered by allign the text,padding,margin, and everything else I could google.
