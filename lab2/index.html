	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>This is Cecilia Michel,I also go by Ceci or CC.
	I love Star Wars and Harry Potter, I'm a Hufflepuff.
	I love all types of food,just dont hand me a celery or an olive.
	I enjoy anything horror,thriller and mystery related,my favorite horror movie is Killer Klowns from Outerspace.
	I enjoy playing video games like: Castlevania, Metroid, DragonAge, Dead Space, Pokemon and curently I am playing Genshin Impact.My favorite past time is doodling and listening to podcast.
	I look foward to learning eveything, since coding is relatively new to me, just so you know I am very stubborn so
	often times,I take longer to learn things since I like testing the waters myself.</p>
