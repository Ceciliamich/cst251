		<p>Hello World</p>
<body>This is Cecilia Michel,I also go by Ceci or CC.
I love Star Wars and Harry Potter, I'm a Hufflepuff.
I love all types of food,just dont hand me a celery or an olive.
I enjoy anything horror,thriller and mystery related,my favorite horror movie is Killer Klowns from Outerspace.
I enjoy playing video games like: Castlevania, Metroid, DragonAge, Dead Space, Pokemon and curently I am playing Genshin impact.My favorite past time is doodling and listening to podcast.
I look foward to learning eveything, since coding is relatively new to me, just so you know I am very stubborn so
often times,I take longer to learn things since I like testing the waters myself.</body>
